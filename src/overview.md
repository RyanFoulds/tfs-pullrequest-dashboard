# Pull Request Dashboard

When working with a codebase that can span dozens of different code repositories, it can be difficult to keep track of the pull requests that you have created, or ones created by others that you may need to review.  This extension solves this issue by providing a place that pull requests across all repositories can be viewed on a single page.

## Pull Request Dashboard Code Hub

This extension adds a new hub to the code section of Visual Studio Team Services/Team Foundation Service for viewing all active pull requests across all repositories.

### Pull Request Categories

The hub queries for all active pull requests, and groups them into several different categories.  Each category sorts pull requests, showing the oldest pull requests first.

* Requested by me - Pull requests requested by the current user
* Assigned to me - Pull requests created by another user that have the current user assigned as a reviewer
* Assigned to my team - Pull requests created by another user that have a team assigned as a reviewer that the current user is directly or indirectly a member of.
    * Indirect team membership means that a team that the current user is not a member of, but one of the teams that the user *is* a member of, is a member of the team (ex. User memberof Team1 memberof Team2).  This allows for pull requests assigned to "virtual" teams: a team made up of several other teams (ex. "UX Team" is made up of "UX Team 1" & "UX Team 2").
    * **Note**: Currently only supported for on-premises Team Foundation Server installations, due to APIs used that are currently unavailable in Visual Studio Team Services
* Other Open pull requests - All other active pull requests that don't fall into any of the above categories

### Pull Request Details
Each pull request displayed shows a number of useful pieces of information.

* PR Title & Author
* Repository name, from branch & to branch
* Tags - Status tags for the pull request
    * Tag showing conflicts, if the pull request has conflicts
    * Tag showing if the pull request is a draft
    * Tag showing if the pull request is set to auto-complete
    * Tag for each status set on the pull request
* Reviewers
    * Each reviewer on the PR has an icon next to their name indicating their vote
        * Solid Green Circle Checkmark = Approved
        * Hollow Green Circle Checkmark = Approved With Suggestions
        * Yellow Circle Dash = Waiting for Author
        * Red Circle X = Rejected
    * If a reviewer is marked as required on a PR, an asterisk is added next to their name (ex "User1*" indicates that User1 is a required reviewer on the PR)

### Filtering by Repository

For an organization with dozens of different code repositories, an individual developer may only actively work in a handful of those repos, and may not care about PRs in other repos.  Next to the Other Pull Requests group header is a filter button that allows users to select just the repositories that they are interested in, and the Other Open Pull Requests category will dynamically update to show PRs only in repos selected.  Filter selections will be saved, allowing subsequent page loads to keep the user's filter selection.

### Settings

At the top right of the dashboard plugin is a button which will drop down user-specific settings.  The settings supported are:

* Date Format - specifies the format to display PR creation date timestamp.  Default is "dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm".
* All Projects - show pull requests from repositories across all projects.
* Hide Draft PRs - hide pull requests marked as draft.

## Pull Request Dashboard Widget

This extension also adds a new widget that can be added to any VSTS dashboard.

### Widget Display

The widget shows a more compact version of the pull request details, compared to the code hub dashboard.  The differences are:

* The name of the person that created the pull request, as well as the date created is not displayed.
    * That information is still accessible as a tooltip by hovering your cursor over the PR creators image in the widget.
* The individual names of reviewers are not displayed for each PR.  Instead, the icons indicating the type of vote is shown, with the number of reviewers that have responded with same vote next to the icon.
    * Hovering over the vote icon in the widget will display the list of reviewers that responded with that vote.

### Widget Configuration

The widget allows configuration of the size, as well as the category of pull requests to display.  The categories are:

* Requested By Me - Pull requests created by the current user.
* Assigned To Me - Pull requests where the current user is assigned as a reviewer.
* Assigned To My Team - Pull requests assigned to the team of the current user.
* All - All pull requests, with no filtering applied.
